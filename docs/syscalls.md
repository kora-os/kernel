# System Calls

KoraOS has a small, KoraOS-private syscall ABI. The calls are *shaped* like
their POSIX namesakes to ease a future libc shim, but the numbering is our own.

## Calling convention

`x8` holds the syscall number; arguments go in `x0`, `x1`, `x2` (AAPCS order);
`svc #0` traps into the kernel; the return value comes back in `x0`.

The numbers are defined in two places that **must stay in sync**:
[`include/sys/syscall.h`](../include/sys/syscall.h) (kernel) and
[`user/libk/abi.h`](../user/libk/abi.h) (userland). Userland C prototypes and
the `struct` layouts are in [`user/libk/koraos.h`](../user/libk/koraos.h); the
assembly stubs are in [`user/libk/syscall.S`](../user/libk/syscall.S). The
kernel dispatches them in [`src/sys/syscall.c`](../src/sys/syscall.c).

## Notes per call

- **`write`**: fd 1 (stdout) and 2 (stderr) go to the console. A writable file
  descriptor at fd 3 or above writes at its cursor; append selects current EOF
  for every call. Returns accepted bytes, possibly a short write on exhaustion,
  or `-1`. `sync` reports durable completion.
- **`read`**: `fd` 0 reads a line from the console (echoed, backspace honoured,
  returns at newline or when the buffer fills). `fd ≥ 3` reads from an open file.
- **`alloc_pages`** / **`free_pages`**: Amiga-style memory: a run of `count`
  contiguous, zeroed 4 KB pages (`KORAOS_PAGE_SIZE`) anywhere in RAM, returned
  by its base address. The kernel records each run against the calling task, so
  `free_pages` needs no size, rejects addresses the task does not own, and
  everything still allocated is reclaimed when the task is reaped. libk's
  `malloc` builds on these (see
  [writing-userland-programs.md](writing-userland-programs.md)). There is no
  `sbrk`: with one flat address space, memory after a heap is usually someone
  else's, so a contiguous break cannot grow reliably.
- **`spawn`**: creates a task for the program. Without `SPAWN_NOWAIT` (flags
  0) it blocks the caller until the child has exited, then returns the child's
  pid; with `SPAWN_NOWAIT` it returns the pid at once and the child runs
  alongside (a background job). Either way, reap the child with `waitpid`.
  libk's `spawn(name, argc, argv)` is the flags-0 form. `name` is resolved to a filesystem path: a bare
  name is looked up through `c:` (initially `sys:bin`), with no fallback to
  `/bin` if the assign or command is missing; other names use the caller's
  volume-aware path resolver (see
  [filesystem.md](filesystem.md)). `argv` entries are copied onto the child's
  stack and delivered as `main(argc, argv)`.
- **`wait`**: reaps an exited child, `pid` or any child for `-1`, storing its
  exit code in `*code` (which may be `NULL`) and returning its pid. It blocks
  until one exits, unless `WNOHANG` is set, in which case it returns `0` if
  none has. `-1` means the caller has no such child. libk's `wait(pid)`
  returns the exit code directly. A child whose parent exits first becomes an
  orphan and is reaped by the kernel.
- **`msleep`**: blocks for at least `ms` milliseconds, in whole 10 ms ticks
  (plus up to one tick); other tasks run meanwhile. `msleep(0)` yields.
- **`forbid`** / **`permit`**: after AmigaOS's `Forbid()`/`Permit()`. `forbid`
  keeps the big kernel lock across returns to EL0 until the matching `permit`,
  so no other core can be in the kernel meanwhile, and stops this task being
  preempted (interrupts still run). They nest; blocking breaks the forbid only
  while the task sleeps; exiting ends it. See [locking.md](locking.md).
- **`open`**: accepts one access mode (`O_RDONLY`, `O_WRONLY`, `O_RDWR`) and
  create/exclusive/truncate/append flags below. Exclusive requires create;
  truncate and append require writable access. Create alone preserves an
  existing file and may create a read-only handle on writable media. Directories
  accept only plain `O_RDONLY`. The kernel reserves a descriptor before
  creating or truncating, so a full table cannot mutate the file. fds 0/1/2
  are the console; real files start at 3.
- **`lseek`**: `whence` is `SEEK_SET` / `SEEK_CUR` / `SEEK_END`; the new offset
  must land within `[0, size]`. Not valid on directory fds.
- **`readdir`**: returns one entry per call from a directory fd. Skips deleted
  entries, the volume label, and `.` / `..`. `name` is UTF-8.
- **`stat`**: reports size and whether the path is a directory.
- **`chdir`**: changes only the calling task's current directory. Supports
  device/volume prefixes, current-volume absolute paths, relative paths, `.` and
  `..`. The target must be a directory; failure preserves cwd. Children inherit
  cwd at spawn and can change it independently.
- **`getcwd`**: writes a NUL-terminated canonical path such as `boot:docs`, using
  a unique volume label or the device slot when that label is ambiguous or
  collides with another namespace name. The supplied byte capacity must include
  the terminator; invalid or undersized buffers return `-1`. Returns `0` on
  success, rather than a pointer.

- **`volume_info`**: enumerate mounted FAT32 volumes by zero-based index. Reports
  the device slot, volume label, boot-volume flag and read-only flag. Returns
  `1` for an item and `0` at the end; invalid output pointers return `-1`.
- **`assign`**: create or replace a global, single-target assign to an existing
  directory. Relative targets use the caller's cwd. A NULL target removes an
  assign; removing an unknown assign fails. `sys:` is immutable; `c:` can be
  replaced or removed. Targets are resolved snapshots, and failed replacements
  preserve the previous target. Device-slot names remain reserved.
- **`assign_info`**: enumerate assigns by zero-based index. Reports the name,
  canonical qualified target and immutable flag. Returns `1` for an item,
  `0` at the end or `-1` for invalid output pointers.

- **`sync`**: flushes every writable mounted volume, including cached data,
  allocation tables, directory metadata and FSInfo. Read-only volumes are
  skipped. It attempts later volumes even if an earlier one failed and returns
  `-1` if any flush failed. Closing a descriptor does not imply sync.
- **`unlink`**: removes a file and its clusters. Directories, read-only files
  and live handles are rejected.
- **`mkdir`**: creates one directory with `.` and `..` entries. Its parent must
  exist; it does not create a chain of missing parents.
- **`rmdir`**: removes an empty directory. Root, cwd/assign pins, live directory
  handles and nonempty directories are rejected.
- **`rename`**: renames within one volume. Existing destination entries are
  preserved, apart from a case-only update of the same source. Open handles,
  cwd/assign pins, cross-volume moves and moving a directory under itself fail.

File I/O validates descriptor permissions even for zero bytes. Valid file
zero-byte calls may use a NULL buffer; console output retains its pointer
checks. File lengths above `UINT32_MAX`, invalid buffers and invalid flags
return `-1`. The kernel API retains detailed errors; user syscalls map them to
`-1`.

File paths for `open`, `stat`, `chdir` and explicit `spawn` paths use the same
namespace rules; `/` selects the current volume's root. Syscall numbers 14 to
31 belong to the scheduler/memory track; filesystem additions use 32 to 47.

## Structs and constants

From [`user/libk/koraos.h`](../user/libk/koraos.h) (mirrored kernel-side in
`src/sys/syscall.c`, keep the layouts identical):

```c

#define O_CREAT 0x100
#define O_TRUNC 0x200
#define O_APPEND 0x400
#define O_EXCL 0x800
#define SEEK_SET 0
#define SEEK_CUR 1
#define SEEK_END 2

#define DIRENT_NAME_MAX 766   /* UTF-8 bytes incl. NUL (255 UTF-16 units * 3) */

struct dirent {
    unsigned long size;
    int           is_dir;
    char          name[DIRENT_NAME_MAX];
};

struct stat {
    unsigned long size;

    char device[8];         /* slot name without colon */
    char label[12];         /* FAT label, or empty */
    unsigned int flags;
};

struct assign_info {
    char name[32];          /* assign name without colon */
    char target[KORA_PATH_MAX];
    unsigned int flags;
};

struct fb_info {           /* filled by fb_info() */
    unsigned long addr;    /* framebuffer base (physical == virtual) */
    unsigned int  width;
    unsigned int  height;
    unsigned int  pitch;   /* bytes per row */
    unsigned int  bpp;     /* bits per pixel */
};
```

## Adding a syscall

1. Add the number to **both** `include/sys/syscall.h` and `user/libk/abi.h`.
2. Add an assembly stub in `user/libk/syscall.S` (`SYSCALL name, SYS_NAME`).
3. Add the C prototype (and any structs) to `user/libk/koraos.h`.
4. Implement `sys_<name>` and add a `case` in `syscall_handle` in
   `src/sys/syscall.c`. Validate user pointers with `uptr_ok`.
